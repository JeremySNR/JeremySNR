### 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy
I build lifelike voice agents that help travel brands answer calls, qualify leads, and handle service at any hour. No menus. No chatbots. Just natural, two-way voice in multiple languages.

- Travellers hate waiting. Teams hate chasing.  
- We turn phone demand into fast, human-sounding conversations.  
- Integrated with the tools travel teams already use.

---

### ✈️ What I’m focused on
- **Airline disruption flows** rebooking, credits, schedule changes
- **After-hours capture** for tour operators and agencies
- **Sales acceleration** instant call-back from web forms
- **Multilingual routing** accents, locales, and regional nuances
- **Enterprise rollouts** governance, security, and data protection

---

### 🧭 A few representative projects
- **Neural Voice** — voice-to-voice AI for travel contact centres and sales teams  
- **Branded voice assistants** — on-brand tone, fast context grounding, CRM handoff  
- **Travel data capture** — dates, airports, cabins, pax details, preferences, all cleanly structured for CRMs

> People still pick up the phone when plans change. Voice should feel personal, instant, and intelligent, not robotic.
